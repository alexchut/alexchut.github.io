      <h3>What is xG?!</h3>
      <aside>April 12, 2018</aside>
      <hr>
      <p>xG is a freaky, mysterious newer metric thats being used more and more in the analytics world. I'm going to do my best
        to explain what the metric is, what it measures, and clear up some misconceptions that people have about xG.</p>
      <h5>What is it?</h5>
      <p>xG, in shortened terms, measures the quality of shots that a team or player makes during a match. Football analysts
        have always known that all shots are not equal, there are variables that can change the course of any shot. For example,
        a header off of a cross will have a much higher xG value than a shot from 17 yards away fom the goal. Shots are recorded
        over time, and after enough data on shots is collected, an xG value is able to be given to each shot that represents
        the possibility that that shot would result in a goal. Keep in mind that the data collected to give xG values is
        taken from many teams over many matches, so the probability that each shot is converted into a goal is based on an
        average of all of the teams from the league.</p>

      <div class="xG-map" style="text-align: center;">

          <img src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/scisports-production/2a8d8a_b0010c24664a4bd08a88c20f71256de3.png" alt="Heat Map">

      <p>As an example, imagine that Borussia Dortmund takes seven shots in a match, and somehow, all of their xG values are
        .1, over the whole match their xG value would be 0.7. This means that an average team in the 1. Bundesliga would
        be expected to score 0.7 goals based on the quality of shots that Borussia Dortmund took during the match. This works
        the same way for players. If Dortmund
        <em>scores</em>, on one of these seven shots, they would be outperforming their xG of 0.7. They are outperforming average
        teams on their ability to convert shots into goals. Teams or players that consistently outperform their xG are considered
        exceptional, and should be watched carefully.</p>
      <p>xG is commonly provided by companies like Opta and Prozone, that collect data on football matches, with much better
        technology than I have. They then use this data to calculate xG values for different locations. The way they give
        xG values to shots is by splitting the field up into "sections" (like below but way more zones), and calculating
        the probability of making a shot from that zone, based on other variables that influenced the shot such as being
        off of a dribble, ground pass, cross, being in open play, etc.</p>

      <p>A common misconception with xG is that it is a predictive metric. It is easy to believe, if an xG value is shown before
        a game, or someone sees xG without context, that xG is
        <em>predicting</em> the amount of goals that a team or player will score. While xG and xG/Acutal Goals are great predictors
        of future performance in players and teams, the metric is not a predictive one. It is also almost completely useless
        to look at xG and compare it to goals without first looking at the mount of shots and shots on goal that a team took.
        A team may have a high xG value because they took a LOT of very low quality shots, and that isn't something that
        is really seen as good. A team that carefully placed their shots, but made sure they were of high quality would also
        have a high xG value, but clearly this team would be better than the team that took many low value shots.</p>
