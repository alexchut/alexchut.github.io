      <h3>xPDO, what is it and how it fixes PDO</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>Statsbomb posted an <a href="https://statsbomb.com/2016/04/pdo-in-footballsoccer-is-stupid-please-stop-using-it/">article</a> about PDO in 2016 addressing its problems and why it is not a good metric to use. With the introduction of new technology, the criticism that Statsbomb made no longer holds as much weight as it did before.</p>
      <h5>What is xPDO?</h5>
      <p>xPDO was introduced by <a href="http://11tegen11.net">a football analytics blog</a> in 2015, before Statsbomb's article. To obtain a team's PDO and xPDO value, you use the following formulas:</p>
      <pre><code>
        PDO  = ((Goals For/Shots For) + (1-(Goals Against/Shots Against)))*1000
        xPDO = ((xG For/Shots For) + (1-(xG Against/Shots Against)))*1000
      </code></pre>
      <p>While PDO is mostly luck based, teams generally float towards the 1000 value. Teams that have values over 1000 are "lucky" and teams that have below 1000 values are not as lucky.</p>
      <p>PDO can be beaten by either making a higher percentage of shots, or saving a higher percentage of shots. What xPDO does is very similar to PDO, but it also addresses the problems that Statsbomb brought up.</p>
      <p>The first point that Statsbomb made was that PDO is theoretically flawed. While finishing and saving is almost random while observing on a league wide scale, it is a good metric for observing individual teams. Statsbomb says that PDO is not a good metric "because it treats all shots as equal." This is true and it is a valid criticism of PDO.</p>
      <p>Newer and more accurate xG models give us the ability to measure a teams <em>xPDO</em>, or "how efficiently a teams converts shots into goals, and prevents the opponent from doing so, given shot quality for and against, and assuming league average conversion of xG into goals," according to 11tegen11, the blog mentioned above.</p>
      <p>Statsbomb also brings up the point that PDO "combines attacking and defensive conversion as if they are remotely related." Teams have infinitely many ways to defend and attack, but football is a <em>team</em> sport, and the shots taken, and the quality of those shots is dependent on how the team plays as a whole. xPDO introduces the quality dimension to the PDO equation. Attacking conversion and save conversion still are not conventionally related, xPDO yields a good measure of how a team works as a whole relative to other teams, and works fantastically when paired <em>with</em> conventional PDO.</p>
      <p>Statsbomb's last point is that every team does not completely regress on the PDO scale. Yes, teams do not completely regress, but 11tegen11 showed that teams do not actually approach 1000, but stay <a href="http://11tegen11.net/2013/01/06/what-is-a-normal-pdo/">between the 980 to 1040 zone</a>. The main backing behind this point is that not all shots are equal. xG being factored into the PDO equation fixes this problem by quantifying the quailty of the shots taken in the PDO equation.</p>
      <p>If a team is consistently taking high quality shots, and preventing high quality shots from being taken, they will have a high xPDO value. If a team takes bad shots and allows good shots to be taken on them, they will have a low xPDO value. xPDO does a great job of taking the randomness out of PDO, because the quality of shots taken and allowed are directly dependent on the players on the field and the decisions they make.</p>
